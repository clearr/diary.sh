diary.sh is a shell script to keep a diary.

It automatically creates a file (${DIARY_PREFIX}/<year>/<month>) if it does not
exist, inserts a header for each day, and opens the file with the text editor
(specified by the EDITOR environment variable). If DIARY_PREFIX environment
variable is not set, ~/diary is used.
