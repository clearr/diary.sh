diary.sh is a shell script to keep a diary.

 * It automatically creates a file if it does not exist, and opens the file
   with the text editor (specified by the EDITOR environment variable).
   If DIARY_DIR is not set, ~/diary is used.

 * search subcommand is available to grep over all diary files.
