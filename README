diary.sh is a shell script to keep a diary.

 * It automatically creates a file (${DIARY_PREFIX}/<year>/<month>) if it does
   not exist, inserts a header for each day, and opens the file with the text
   editor (specified by the EDITOR environment variable). If DIARY_PREFIX
   environment variable is not set, ~/diary is used.

 * DIARY_TEMPLATE environment variable can be used to specify a template file.
   If specified, the file is inserted after the header for each day.

 * grep subcommand is available to grep over all diary files.
